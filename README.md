# PolyAdmin
Polytoria chat moderation, fun, utility & misc commands. Made by Index.
Feedback Form: 

> An example game with admin commands built in (free admin for all players visiting) can be visited here to try out the model before adding it into your own games: https://polytoria.com/games/2537

> **You do not have to add your own USER ID to the "permissions" table if you are the owner of the game.**

# Prefix
To use commands, your message must start with a ":" colon (this can be changed later in settings per the game developer's wishes by changing the "prefix" variable at the top of the script).

# Known Bugs
- **Fixing Usernames with Spaces** - Slight fix implemented by adding shortended usernames.

# Commands Available (10)
- **:help** - Displays a list of commands in chat to the user who executed the command.
- **:shutdown** [REASON (required)] - Acts like a server shutdown by kicking every player including yourself (could be used for publishing updates on the fly)
This list is currently in the process of being rewritten due to the model rewrite.

## More commands will be added in the future, multiple commands have been removed from this list due to them being buggy, or Polytoria's features limiting them heavily.
