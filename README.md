# PolytoriaAdmin
Polytoria admin commands &amp; tools. Made by Index.

> An example game with admin commands built in (free admin for all players visiting) can be visited here to try out the model before adding it into your own games: https://polytoria.com/games/1975

# Prefix
To use commands, your message must start with a ":" colon.

# Future Updates
- **Shortening Commands** - Adding "all", "everyone", "me", "others" player attributes & allowing shortened usernames (eg. "Ind" would still execute the said command on Index)
- **Adding More Commands**

# Known Bugs
- **Fixing Usernames with Spaces** - Currently usernames with spaces are completely broken. If you can help me out with this, please message me!

# Commands Available (10)
- **:help** - Displays a list of commands in chat to the user who executed the command.
- **:shutdown** [REASON (required)] - Acts like a server shutdown by kicking every player including yourself (could be used for publishing updates on the fly)
- **:announce** [TEXT (required)] - Announces a global message to the server (filtered so you can't say naughty naughty words)
- **:kick** [PLAYER (required)] [REASON (required)] - Kicks the player from the server.
- **:explode** [PLAYER (required)] - Player go boom boom
- **:kill** [PLAYER (required, default: me)] - Player stepped on a lego
- **:damage** [PLAYER (required)] [DAMAGE (required)] - Player gets an owie

- **:createNPC** - Creates an sus NPC by the user who executed the command.

## More commands will be added in the future, multiple commands have been removed from this list due to them being buggy, or Polytoria's features limiting them heavily.

Hope you enjoy!
