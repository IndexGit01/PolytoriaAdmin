# PolyAdmin
Polytoria chat moderation, fun, utility & misc commands.

> An example game with admin commands built in (free admin for all players visiting) can be visited here to try out the model before adding it into your own games: https://polytoria.com/games/1975

> **YOU MUST ADD YOUR USER ID UNDER THE PERMISSIONS TABLE FOR THIS TO WORK.**

# Note (rewrite information)
A complete rewrite with more commands, bug fixes & more will be released sometime this week! Stay tuned!

# Prefix
To use commands, your message must start with a ":" colon (this can be changed later in settings per the game developer's wishes).

# Future Updates
Edit: This list has been deleted since most if not all of the items have been fixed or added in the rewrite (look above for more information about the rewrite).

# Known Bugs
- **Fixing Usernames with Spaces** - Currently usernames with spaces are completely broken. If you can help me out with this, please message me!

# Commands Available (10)
- **:help** - Displays a list of commands in chat to the user who executed the command.
- **:shutdown** [REASON (required)] - Acts like a server shutdown by kicking every player including yourself (could be used for publishing updates on the fly)
- **:announce** [TEXT (required)] - Announces a global message to the server (filtered so you can't say naughty naughty words)
- **:kick** [PLAYER (required)] [REASON (required)] - Kicks the player from the server.

## More commands will be added in the future, multiple commands have been removed from this list due to them being buggy, or Polytoria's features limiting them heavily.

Hope you enjoy!
